# Question 39:

To perform an arithmetic shift right on the binary value \(10011101\) (assuming it's an 8-bit register value):

Arithmetic shift right (ASR) preserves the sign bit (the leftmost bit) while shifting the other bits to the right. Here's how it works:

1. **Original Binary Value:** \(10011101\)

2. **Arithmetic Shift Right:**

   - Shift all bits one position to the right.
   - The sign bit (leftmost bit, which is \(1\) in this case) is preserved.

3. **Result After Arithmetic Shift Right:**
   - \(11001110\)

Therefore, after performing an arithmetic shift right on \(10011101\), the register value becomes \(11001110\) in binary.
